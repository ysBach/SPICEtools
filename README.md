# SPICEtools
Python package to do simple SPICE calculations for space missions.

Originally developed for the SPHEREx mission since early 2024, and designed to collect some generally usable tools related to the SPICE toolkit. As of Oct 2024, the team decided to rely on [`kete`](https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/kete) from the NEO Surveyor mission. Thus, this repo should be considered as an archive, and no serious further improvement is planned.


Some tips & scripts are available in the `docs/` directory.
